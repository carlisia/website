In the context of [[model context protocol|MCP]], [[provenance]] refers explicitly to the ability to clearly trace, verify, and audit the **origin and history of data, resources, decisions, and actions** within MCP-enabled AI workflows.

More concretely, provenance within MCP includes:

- **Where resources originated from:**  
   Explicit documentation of sources such as databases, files, APIs, or other MCP servers providing context.
- **Which exact resources were used in generating prompts:**  
   Clear auditability of every structured prompt and associated context used in interactions with language models.
- **When, why, and how actions were taken:**  
   Auditable records showing explicit consent, policies, and validation logic behind every decision and tool invocation.
- **Who authorized or consented to an action:**  
   Clear records showing explicit authorization and consent provided by users or policy-based logic.
- **Transparency of decision-making:**  
   Ability to explicitly inspect and verify each step in MCP interactions (Client-to-Server, Server-to-External system, LLM-to-Client interactions).

### Why is Provenance critical in MCP?

- **Security and trust:**  
   Ensuring every action and decision can be audited for compliance, regulatory purposes, and trustworthiness.
- **Compliance and governance:**  
   Adhering to strict enterprise, regulatory, or ethical requirements around data usage, consent, privacy, and accountability.
- **Debugging and traceability:**  
   Quickly identifying and resolving problems by clearly tracing back through structured interactions and decisions.
- **Transparency for users:**  
   Providing explicit transparency, allowing users to fully understand and trust the interactions happening on their behalf.

### Community discussions and proposals

As of the current MCP specification (**Revision: [2025-06-18](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)**), provenance is not fully detailed within the spec itself. However, it seems to be an issue recognized as essential by the community:

- [Proposal: Incorporate Secure Software Supply Chain Principles 路 Issue #526 路 modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/526)
- [[SPEC] Annotations for MCP Requests and Responses (security/privacy) 路 Issue #711 路 modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/711)
