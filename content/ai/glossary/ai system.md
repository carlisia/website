An **AI system** is the comprehensive integration of components that collectively deliver artificial intelligence-powered functionality. It combines the generative capabilities of [[llm|LLMs]], the reasoning and decision-making processes of [[ai agent|agents]], the action-enabling capabilities of [[ai tool|tools]], and the reliability mechanisms of the [[orchestration layer|orchestration layer]]. Additional infrastructure components, such as integration layers, plugin frameworks, or standardized protocols like the [[model context protocol|Model Context Protocol (MCP)]], enhance these systems' portability, scalability, and interoperability.

## Key characteristics

* **Multi-layered** – Built from distinct but cooperating parts (model, agent, tools, orchestration)
* **Context-aware** – Ingests prompts, environmental state, or external data when producing outputs
* **Tool-augmented** – Extends beyond text generation by integrating external capabilities
* **Reliable** – Uses orchestration to handle retries, workflows, and guardrails
* **Interoperable** – Can leverage protocols like MCP for standardized access to tools and resources
* **Scalable** – Supports many tools, agents, and services without exponential integration effort

An AI system represents the **end-to-end assembly** that enables reasoning, action, and reliability simultaneously.

## AI system components

* **[[llm|LLM (Large Language Model)]]** – The generative core component
* **[[ai agent|Agent]]** – The reasoning and decision-making layer
* **[[ai tool|Tool]]** – External capabilities that extend model functionality
* **Integration layers** – Custom connectors, plugin frameworks, or standardized protocols such as MCP
* **[[orchestration layer|Orchestration layer]]** – Ensures workflows, retries, logging, and guardrails

## AI system vs. subcomponents

* **LLM ≠ AI system** – A large language model generates text but lacks orchestration, memory, or tool access capabilities.
* **Agent ≠ AI system** – An agent can reason, but without supporting infrastructure, it remains fragile and limited.
* **Tool ≠ AI system** – Tools provide specific capabilities but require agents to invoke and coordinate them.
* **Orchestration ≠ AI system** – Orchestration ensures reliability but does not reason or generate content.

**Key distinction:** An AI system represents the integration of model + agent + tools + orchestration (optionally enhanced by protocols like MCP) into a unified, goal-serving entity.

## Examples

A customer support AI system demonstrates this integration by:

1. Using an **LLM** to interpret user complaints and requests.
2. Running an **agent** to determine whether to respond directly, search documentation, or escalate the issue.
3. Invoking **tools** (such as knowledge base search or ticketing APIs) through custom connectors or MCP protocols.
4. Relying on the **orchestration layer** to manage retries, apply compliance filters, and log all interactions.

From the user's perspective, this appears as a seamless "AI system," while the underlying architecture represents a carefully orchestrated collaboration of multiple specialized components.

## Non-examples

* **Standalone LLMs** – These generate text but lack tools, orchestration, or integration capabilities.

* **Single agents** – These can reason and act, but without orchestration or supporting infrastructure they do not constitute a complete system.

* **Individual tools** – A database query API or mathematical engine alone does not qualify as an AI system.

* **Isolated orchestration** – Workflow automation or retry mechanisms without an agent and model do not meet the criteria.

* **Traditional machine learning models** – Classifiers, translators, or recommenders that produce outputs but lack autonomy, tool use, or system-level integration.

> **Note:** An AI system requires the integration of multiple components (LLM, agents, tools, orchestration, and supporting infrastructure). No single component alone constitutes a complete system.
