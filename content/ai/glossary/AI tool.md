An **AI tool** is a capability beyond an [[large language model (llm)|LLM]]'s native text generation that an [[AI agent|AI agent]] can invoke to access data, perform actions, or integrate with services. Tools can be connected in different ways: through direct API calls, plugin frameworks, or standardized protocols such as the [[model context protocol|Model Context Protocol (MCP)]].

## Key characteristics

- **Action-enabling** – Executes tasks the LLM cannot perform directly (e.g., database queries, API calls, code execution,, file system access)
- **Structured interface** – Defined inputs, outputs, and error formats
- **Discoverable** – May be listed dynamically (e.g., via MCP) or hardcoded in integrations
- **Interoperable** – Works across systems when exposed through common standards like MCP
- **Composable** – Can be combined into multi-step workflows coordinated by an [[orchestration layer|orchestration layer]]
- **Permissioned** – Access can be governed by security and policy rules

Also:

- **Passive** - Wait to be called, don't initiate actions independently
- **Functional** - Designed to perform **specific** operations when invoked
- **Specialized** - Built for particular use cases or domains
- **Variable predictability** - Range from deterministic to highly variable outputs

A tool is not itself intelligent. Its power comes from being combined with [[AI agent|AI agents]], [[orchestration layer|orchestration]], and [[large language model (llm)|models]] into larger [[agentic system|agentic]] or [[AI system|AI systems]].

## Tool behavior spectrum

### Deterministic tools

- **Calculator APIs** - 2+2 always equals 4
- **Database queries** - Same query returns same data (at that moment)
- **File operations** - Reading a file returns the same content

### Non-deterministic tools

- **LLM-powered tools** - Text summarization, content generation, analysis
- **Agent-based tools** - Research assistants, complex workflow automators
- **AI services** - Image generation, recommendation engines
- **Dynamic systems** - Weather APIs, stock prices, search results

## Understanding the relationships

### Tool vs. [[large language model (llm)|LLM]]

- **LLM** – Generates text, code, or reasoning outputs from prompts
- **Tool** – Executes actions or retrieves data the LLM cannot produce on its own

#### What LLMs can do

- Draft a document from a prompt
- Translate a sentence
- Generate code snippets
- Answer factual questions (within training data)

#### What Tools can do

- Query a live database
- Retrieve current web information
- Add events to a calendar
- Execute precise calculations

**Key distinction:** An LLM produces content; a tool performs operations or retrieves information beyond the model’s native scope.

## Examples

In a travel-planning [[AI system|AI system]]:

1. The **[[large language model (llm)|LLM]]** processes the user's request: "Find me a flight to Paris next week"
2. The **[[AI agent|AI agent]]** (powered by the LLM) reasons: "I need to search for flight availability to Paris for next week"
3. LLMs with native function calling (GPT-4, Claude) directly generate structured tool calls to the flight search tool, which could be:
   - A direct API integration
   - Exposed by an [[MCP server|MCP server]]
   - Available through a plugin system
4. The **[[orchestration layer|orchestration layer]]** executes the tool call:
   - Manages the connection (API, plugin, or MCP [[MCP client|client]]/[[MCP server|server]])
   - Handles retries and error recovery
   - Logs the interaction
5. The tool returns flight data to the orchestration layer
6. The **LLM** receives and interprets the results, generating a natural language response: "I found 3 flights to Paris next week. The best option is..."

This workflow transforms a static language model into an active system that can:

- Understand intent through natural language
- Make decisions about which tools to use
- Execute real-world actions
- Interpret and present results meaningfully

## Non-examples

- **The LLM itself** – It generates predictions but does not expose callable actions
- **Training data** – Knowledge embedded in the model, not an invocable capability
- **Static outputs** – Prewritten text or fixed responses, which lack structured invocation

> [!TIP] A tool must be an _active capability_ that an agent can call, not just information or generation.
