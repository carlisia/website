**Register:** [MCP Academy PNW · Luma](https://luma.com/mcpacademypnw)

**Date and location:** Wednesday, October 29 - Bellevue, Washington

## Talk

Using a real-world **incident response automation server** as example, in just 15 minutes I’ll show you how to flip your thinking from a task-oriented to a goal-oriented mindset. In this talk, I will walk you through a goal-driven approach to building [[MCP server|MCP servers]] that enable [[AI agent|AI agents]] to pursue complex objectives independently while maintaining safety and control.

## Key Takeaways

Attendees will leave with actionable knowledge to:

- Design [[MCP server|MCP servers]] that enable autonomous [[AI agent|agent]] behavior while maintaining human oversight
- Map complex business workflows into phase-based architectures suitable for [[orchestration layer|AI orchestration]]
- Implement outcome-focused [[AI tool|tools]] that provide rich context and control to [[AI agent|AI agents]]
- Build safety mechanisms that prevent runaway automation while preserving efficiency
- Apply these patterns to diverse domains beyond incident response (content publishing, deployment pipelines, customer support workflows)

## Target Audience

This talk is for experienced software engineers, architects, and DevOps professionals who are interested in the future of [[tags/ai|AI]] and automation. Attendees should have an understanding of software design principles and be familiar with building and consuming APIs. No prior experience with [[model context protocol|MCP]] is required.

## Speaker

I am a a senior software engineer with experience in Go, distributed systems, and open source, having served as a core maintainer for Cloud Native projects including Velero and Knative. My unique perspective combines engineering experience with recent explorations at the intersection of AI, biology, and system design.
