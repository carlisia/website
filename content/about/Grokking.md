Grokking implies experiential, embodied learning, something beyond surface-level exposure. It hints of an orientation towards fluid intuition, rather than rigid knowing or memorization. It is something that happens when we go beyond fast consumption and stick around thru the discomfort, patterns, and contradictions, until "it clicks."

A quick `whois` will reveal I purchased the domain `grokkingtech.io` back in March 2014. I still love the word **grok**. It is both a word, as in, an official, lexical word, and also an interesting term: 

- In **tech, sci-fi, and hacker culture**, “grok” functions as a **term of art**, a _specialized term_ with deeper cultural meaning.
    
- It signals **insider knowledge**, **philosophical orientation**, and **a particular way of knowing**.

> [!tip] Note
> I don't mind so much that it can signal insider knowledge, much like I don't mind terms such as “monad,” “polyfill,” or “idempotent.” Insider terms can be inclusive _when_ they invite people in through learning instead of through gatekeeping.
