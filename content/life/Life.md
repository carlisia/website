## 🌅 Everyday beauty

I am Brazilian born and raised, and have been in the US for decades now. To me it is such a privilege to continue to enjoy this multi-cultural experience that is my life.

For now, I enjoy the blessings of living [in San Diego-CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego), a city that is always sunny and warm most of the time, and in a place with easy beach access and surrounded by all kinds of nature.

I truly savor the "little" moments: the light through the trees on my neighborhood walk, the sound of my kids laughing, the feel of bare feet on the ground. These are the things that recalibrate my nervous system and remind me what’s real, what I want to be present for.

I also enjoy opening up my imagination through connecting with others, traveling, listening to music, reading, [[tags/research|researching]], and experimenting.

Then there are those extra special, transcendental moments when I get to explore escaping into nothingness, maybe on a run, or meditating to binaural beats, sitting in nature doing nothing, or through advanced partnered dancing like salsa and forró, and hopefully, someday, tango.

## 🌙 Dreaming & what is hidden

Lately I've been getting into dream interpretation. (And of course, I also have an AI app for that.) I'm learning to see dreams as a compass, pointing toward truths my waking mind isn’t always ready to articulate. Some of my most relieving dreams involve water.

## 💡 What I’m learning

- That it’s okay not to know. That the unfolding can be beautiful and joyful.

- That life doesn’t have to be perfect to be deeply worth living. Same goes for me, I don't have to be perfect. And you, you don't have to be perfect either.
