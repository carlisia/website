> How much can your platform influence the non-deterministic things that happen
> Who is responsible for the quality and safety of that outcome
> How much that resides in the platform determines how the platform can make handling that easier: efficiency, but opinionated
> -> Risk and impact greatly determine where to draw the line. Ex, security concerns is not enough, there are different aspects of security compliance that are load baring for the business
> Decisions:

- what to take on from the ecosystem
- what responsibilities are shared
- what is left out

- where would we reinvest resources saved? development, experimentation, community advocacy?
