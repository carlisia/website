## Definition

The term **"provenance"** originates from the Latin verb **"provenire,"** meaning **"to come forth," "originate," or "arise from."** Traditionally, provenance has been used extensively in disciplines such as art, archaeology, and history to document and verify the origins, custody, and ownership of artifacts, artworks, and documents.

## Provenance in computing and data science

In the context of **computing and data systems**, the adoption of the term **"provenance"** began to gain prominence from the late 20th century onward. It became widely used in disciplines involving **data management, databases, scientific computing, and data security**, referring explicitly to the ability to systematically track and record the lineage of dataâ€”its origin, evolution, and transformations throughout a workflow or lifecycle.

The formal adoption of provenance in computing was significantly influenced by research efforts in the early 2000s, notably by projects such as:
