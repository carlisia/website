## The paradox of building with AI in the loop

As modern software engineers, we're trained in the agile way: ship fast, iterate based on feedback, let design emerge. We start minimal and evolve based on what we learn from users.

But architecting robusts, performant, and useful MCP servers demands the opposite: with LLM in the loop, the system‚Äôs effectiveness is significantly improved by intentionally and explicitly defining constraints upfront. These constraints improve the predictability, discoverability, and usability of your tools. Why?

Because for an LLM to make reasonable choices, it must be carefully guided. They can't read between the lines, infer unstated intentions, or choose between multiple paths to the same goal. They work purely with (their interpretation of) what we explicitly provide. The context we give them becomes their entire universe of what's possible.

And this fundamentally changes the cost of iteration. When we change a tool, we're not just updating its description or restructuring its parameters, we're potentially breaking every agent workflow that depends on it.

### Impact

The disruption from tool changes manifests differently based on the type of MCP client.

#### When there are only humans are in the loop

- **We're competing for clarity in every interaction:** if our tool isn't defined with clear, consistent, and authoritative signals, LLMs will struggle to distinguish it from others or use it correctly.

- **Every inconsistency becomes noise:** ambiguous descriptions, overlapping functionality, or unclear parameters make it exponentially harder for LLMs to reliably select and use our tools.

- **User patterns crystallize around what works:** when users find tool definitions that produce consistent results, they build workflows, share prompts, and create automations based on that specific formulation.

- **Trust compounds or erodes with each interaction:** consistent tool behavior builds user confidence, while unpredictable results drive them to use competing tools.

#### When MCP clients are agents

- **Failure modes become silent degradation:** agents can't course-correct when tools behave unexpectedly; they just propagate errors downstream

  - Agents typically don't have robust error handling for tool selection failures
  - They often make their "best guess" and continue rather than stopping

- **Integration assumptions become permanent contracts:** agent developers hard-code expectations about our tool behavior into their systems.

  - When developers build agent systems that use our MCP tools, they encode assumptions
  - These get embedded in prompts, workflows, and agent architectures
  - Changing our tools breaks these hard-coded expectations
  - This is especially true for production systems where changes require extensive testing

- **Latency and token usage increase significantly:** unclear tools force agents to make multiple attempts or defensive calls, compounding costs.

  - Unclear tools do cause agents to use more tokens in decision-making
  - Agents might make multiple attempts with different tools

- **There's no forgiveness for ambiguity:** agents interpret our tools literally, without the human ability to infer intent from context.

  - Agents can't use context clues the way humans do
  - They interpret descriptions literally
  - Ambiguous parameter names or descriptions lead to consistent misuse

Evolution becomes disruption.

> [!INFO] This creates our constraint paradox
> Traditional software: constraints limit possibilities.
>
> MCP servers: constraints expand effectiveness.

The competitive landscape amplifies this need. As the ecosystem matures, LLMs will maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets. And that users can so trivially swap between MCP servers and tools is not reassuring either. Instead of measuring success by how quickly we can add features, now we prioritize testing how reliably agents can discover and compose our tools from day one.

But please üôè don't come at me üò±. Instead of thinking of this as me suggesting to abandon agile principles, I'd rather you saw it as a realization that building with AI in the loop has different rules. Where traditional software rewards emergent flexibility, MCP servers reward intentional constraints.

Absolutely nothing wrong about yolo'ing your way thru your first MCP servers. I'm just wanting to tell you [when I did that](https://github.com/carlisia/mcp-factcheck), I had to reel myself back from a much deeper abyss than it was fun (or profitable) for me, all because I didn't have this guide that is now in front of your eyeballs! üëÅüëÅ

This article is a playbook for how to use intentional design to mitigate for this paradox when architecting MCP servers.

## Why MCP makes clear intention so very critical, going deeper

When we build an MCP server, our primary user is an LLM. This "user" must:

- Select appropriate tools from what a server provides based solely on tool metadata (name, description, and parameter schemas)
- Reason about when and how to use them
- Compose them into solutions
- Work within context window limits

Here's what LLMs actually see:

```json
{
  "name": "search_documents",
  "description": "Search markdown documents by content or title",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Search term to find in documents"
      },
      "searchIn": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Where to search"
      }
    },
    "required": ["query"]
  }
}
```

This is why vague metadata at ANY level hurts LLM usage:

```json
// Bad: Ambiguous at every level
{
  "name": "process", // Process what?
  "description": "Processes data", // How? What kind?
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "data": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The data" // What format? What content?
      },
      "mode": {
        "type": "string", // What are valid modes?
        "description": "Processing mode"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If there is ONE THING that LLMs are terrible at, it's handling ambiguity. When humans encounter vague tools, we experiment, read docs, ask questions. When LLMs encounter vague tools, they either skip them entirely or misuse them, burning through context and degrading performance. They won't ask for clarification. They will... _confidently guess_.

## tl;dr

This is all that I wanted to convince you of. This is the tl;dr:

- a
- b

Beyond this point, I will share concrete pointers for how to architect an MCP server intentionally enough to get considerable gains üí™ quickly, but not so much that it doesn't feel playful or experimental or productive.

As my Gen Z kid says: "**Trust**."

## Start with intention, not features

The beauty of MCP development is we can start with a single tool and grow from there. We don't need a 50-page specification. We just need one sentence:

"I want to help [someone] do [something]"

That's it. That's our v0.0.1 intention.

Maybe it's:

- "I want to help myself manage my todo lists better"
- "I want to help my team debug production issues faster"
- "I want to see if LLMs can help with code reviews"

This is a hypothesis to test. But having this hypothesis‚Äîhowever rough‚Äîfundamentally changes how we experiment.

### The intention statement framework

Before writing code, write this:

```
This MCP server helps [WHO] to [DO WHAT] with [WHAT CONSTRAINTS]
so that [WHY THIS MATTERS]
```

Examples:

- "This MCP server helps **individual developers** to **manage their personal notes** with **minimal friction** so that **context-switching doesn't kill productivity**"
- "This MCP server helps **SREs** to **debug production issues** with **read-only access** so that **they can find root causes without risking further damage**"

### The "Why Test"

Here's how to know if your intention is strong:

**Weak intention**: "This server processes log files" (that's a WHAT, not a WHY)
**Strong intention**: "This server helps SREs debug production issues" (clear value proposition)

**Test**: Can you measure if you're succeeding?

- Processing log files ‚Üí How do you measure success?
- Helping SREs debug ‚Üí Faster root cause identification? Fewer escalations? ‚úì

## A tale of two MCP servers

Let me tell you about Eduardo and Monica, two developers who learned this lesson very differently.

Monica built FlexiServer. She wanted to create the "Swiss Army knife of MCP servers" that could handle any text processing task:

```go
func ProcessDocument(params struct {
    Action   string      `json:"action"`   // "read", "analyze", "transform", "query"
    Path     string      `json:"path"`
    Options  interface{} `json:"options"`  // Depends on action
}) (interface{}, error) {
    // 2000 lines handling every possible combination
    // Returns different JSON shapes based on action
    // LLM can't predict response structure
}
```

Eduardo built DocAnalyzer. He had one focused goal: help developers understand and improve their documentation quality:

```go
func ExtractDocumentOutline(path string) ([]HeadingNode, error) {
    // Returns hierarchical outline structure
}

func ListBrokenLinks(path string) ([]BrokenLink, error) {
    // Returns list of links that 404
}

func Summarize(path string, maxWords int) (string, error) {
    // Returns plain text summary
}

func ReadingStats(path string) (ReadingStats, error) {
    // Returns time estimate and complexity score
}
```

Six months later:

- Monica's server had 12 GitHub issues like "AI returns wrong response format" and "Can't figure out which action to use"
- Eduardo's server was featured in "Awesome MCP" with the comment: "Finally, doc analysis that just works"

The difference? Eduardo had a clear intention. Monica had possibilities.

## The pitfalls of unclear intention

Without clear intention, MCP server developers fall into predictable traps:

### LLM interaction pitfalls

**The tool granularity confusion**

```go
// Too coarse: LLMs can't reason about this effectively
func ProcessContent(params struct {
    Action   string      `json:"action"`   // "validate", "search", "check", "analyze"
    Content  string      `json:"content"`
    Options  interface{} `json:"options"`  // Depends on action
}) (interface{}, error) {
    switch params.Action {
    case "validate":
        // Full validation? Quick check? What version?
    case "check":
        // How is this different from validate?
    }
}

// Clear intention guides proper boundaries
func ValidateMCPContent(content string, specVersion string) (ValidationResult, error) { }
func CheckQuickFact(claim string) (FactCheckResult, error) { }
func SearchSpecification(query string, section string) ([]SpecMatch, error) { }
```

**The discovery paradox**

```go
// Bad: LLM can't determine when to use this
var ToolDefinitions = []Tool{{
    Name:        "check",
    Description: "Checks MCP content", // Check what? How?
}}

// Good: Clear intention enables discovery
var ToolDefinitions = []Tool{{
    Name:        "validate_mcp_claims",
    Description: "Validate claims about MCP against official specs, returning accuracy status and corrections",
}}
```

### Technical design pitfalls

**The context window waste**

```go
// No clear intention = kitchen sink response
func QueryDatabase(query string) (interface{}, error) {
    return struct {
        Rows     [][]interface{} `json:"rows"`
        Metadata DatabaseMeta    `json:"metadata"`
        Stats    QueryStats      `json:"stats"`
        Explain  QueryPlan       `json:"explain"`
        // 50KB of JSON for a simple query
    }
}

// Clear intention = focused response
func GetUserByEmail(email string) (*User, error) {
    return &User{
        ID:    user.ID,
        Name:  user.Name,
        Email: user.Email,
    }, nil
}
```

**The stateless assumption violation**

```go
// Wrong: Assumes session state
type StatefulServer struct {
    openFiles map[string]*os.File
}

func (s *StatefulServer) OpenFile(path string) (string, error) {
    handle := generateID()
    s.openFiles[handle] = file // LLM might never call CloseFile!
    return handle, nil
}

// Right: Each tool call is independent
func ReadFile(path string) (string, error) {
    data, err := os.ReadFile(path)
    return string(data), err
}
```

### Evolution pitfalls

**The feature creep spiral**

```go
// Started as a "simple markdown processor"
func ProcessMarkdown(params struct {
    Content      string `json:"content"`
    ExecuteCode  bool   `json:"execute_code"`      // Added for one user
    SendEmail    bool   `json:"send_email"`       // Marketing asked
    DeployToAWS  bool   `json:"deploy_to_aws"`    // Why not?
}) (string, error) {
    // 2000 lines of spaghetti
}
```

## During planning: Finding your boundaries

### How narrow is too narrow?

The Goldilocks Test for intention scope:

**Too broad**: "Help with text processing"

- LLMs can't reason about when to use your server
- You'll build a ProcessDocument mega-tool
- Impossible to optimize for any specific use case

**Too narrow**: "Parse Python 3.11.2 async generator expressions in files named 'main.py'"

- Overly restrictive
- Won't evolve naturally
- Probably not worth a whole server

**Just right**: "Help developers understand Python code behavior"

- Clear enough for LLMs to discover
- Focused enough to build cohesive tools
- Flexible enough to evolve with user needs

### One server or many?

Natural boundary detection framework:

**Same server when**:

- Tools naturally chain together (parse ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí report)
- Tools serve the same user persona
- Tools share the same constraints
- Combined value is greater than sum of parts

**Different servers when**:

- Different user personas (developers vs. marketing team)
- Conflicting constraints (read-only analysis vs. write operations)
- No natural workflow between tools
- Different reasons for using them

Example: Eduardo considered adding "fix documentation" tools to DocAnalyzer. But fixing requires write access (different constraint) and serves a different workflow. Better as a separate DocFixer server that could chain with DocAnalyzer.

## During development: The intention-decision method

### Every decision flows through your filter

```
Decision Point ‚Üí Does this serve WHO?
              ‚Üí Does this enable WHAT?
              ‚Üí Does this respect CONSTRAINTS?
              ‚Üí Does this advance WHY?

If all YES ‚Üí Build it
If any NO ‚Üí Decline or save for different server
```

### When intention guides design

**Natural tool boundaries**:

```go
// Intention: Help SREs debug production issues
type DebugServer struct{}

// Each tool has one clear purpose aligned with intention
func (s DebugServer) FindErrorPatterns(timeRange TimeRange) ([]ErrorPattern, error) { }
func (s DebugServer) TraceRequestPath(requestID string) (RequestTrace, error) { }
func (s DebugServer) CompareMetrics(baseline, incident TimeRange) (MetricsDiff, error) { }

// NOT: DebugSystem(action string, params map[string]interface{})
```

**Discoverable descriptions**:

```go
var Tools = []ToolDef{
    {
        Name: "find_error_patterns",
        Description: "Identify recurring error patterns in logs within a time range so that SREs can spot systemic issues",
        // Clear WHO: SREs
        // Clear WHAT: identify patterns
        // Clear WHY: spot systemic issues
    },
}
```

**Actionable errors**:

```go
func ValidateTimeRange(start, end time.Time) error {
    if start.After(end) {
        return fmt.Errorf("start time must be before end time")
    }
    if end.Sub(start) > 24*time.Hour {
        return fmt.Errorf("time range cannot exceed 24 hours for performance reasons")
    }
    // LLM can adjust request based on clear constraints
}
```

## During evolution: When reality meets intention

Your users will surprise you. The question is: how do you evolve without losing focus?

### The three evolution patterns

**1. Deepen (most common)**
Your intention stays the same, but you serve it better:

```go
// V1: Help developers understand code
func ExplainFunction(name string) (string, error) { }

// V2: Same intention, deeper capability
func ExplainFunction(name string, detail Level) (Explanation, error) { }
func VisualizeCallGraph(name string) (GraphData, error) { }
func ExplainWithExamples(name string) (ExplanationWithCode, error) { }
```

**2. Fork (when users pull you in new directions)**
Your users want something adjacent but different:

```go
// Original: DocAnalyzer - helps understand docs
// Users want: "Can it fix the broken links it finds?"

// Wrong: Add fixing to DocAnalyzer (breaks read-only constraint)
// Right: Create DocFixer as a sibling server
```

**3. Pivot (rare, when your intention was wrong)**
Only when you discover your original intention missed the mark entirely:

```go
// Started: "Help developers write better commit messages"
// Discovered: They actually needed "Help developers understand what changed"
// Pivot: Refocus on change analysis, not message writing
```

### Evolution in practice

```go
// V1: Personal use
// Intention: Help individuals track personal tasks so that nothing falls through cracks
type TaskTrackerV1 struct{}

func (t TaskTrackerV1) AddTask(description string) error {
    return saveToFile(description)
}

// V2: Team adoption
// Intention: Help teams track shared tasks so that everyone knows who's doing what
type TaskTrackerV2 struct{}

func (t TaskTrackerV2) AddTask(description, assignee string, watchers []string) error {
    // Still task tracking, but deepened for team collaboration
    task := Task{
        Description: description,
        Assignee:    assignee,
        Watchers:    watchers,
        CreatedAt:   time.Now(),
    }
    return t.storage.Save(task)
}

// V3: Enterprise scale
// Intention: Help organizations track tasks with compliance so that work is auditable
type TaskTrackerV3 struct{}

func (t TaskTrackerV3) AddTask(ctx context.Context, req TaskRequest) error {
    // Core intention intact, enterprise features added
    if err := t.validator.CheckCompliance(req); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return t.storage.SaveWithAudit(ctx, req)
}
```

Each version deepens the same core intention for an expanding audience.

## How about existing APIs?

## Constraints as superpowers

In the MCP world, constraints aren't limitations‚Äîthey're superpowers:

- **Clarity**: LLMs can reason confidently about your tools
- **Trust**: Users know exactly what your server will and won't do
- **Focus**: You can say no to feature creep with confidence
- **Quality**: You can deeply optimize for your specific use case

When someone asks "Can you add X?" and X doesn't serve your intention, "No" becomes a complete sentence.

## Next steps

1. **Write your intention statement** before your next commit
2. **Put it in your README** as the first thing users see
3. **Use it to evaluate every decision**: "Does this serve our intention?"
4. **Let it guide your evolution**: Deepen rather than broaden

Remember: In a world where LLMs are your users, the most powerful thing you can do is be brilliantly narrow. Your intention isn't a constraint‚Äîit's your compass.
