The unquenchable quest for the "WANTING to experience" and "wanting TO KNOW", for those who feel it, is both a blessing and a curse. But never not an adventure! 🚀

For a while now, I’ve been on a side quest of learning quantum physics, particularly as it relates to consciousness, the nature of reality, and computing systems.

Here’s what I’ve been exploring:

• Quantum Computing applied to Distributed Systems 💻

• Information Theory and its role in understanding reality 🌐

And on a more theoretical and philosophical note:

• Consciousness through the lens of Distributed Systems 🧠

• Reality as a Distributed System ⚛️

Federico Faggin's work (along with that of others) has provided me with many unique and valuable insights on all these topics, with direct relevance to my own personal growth, journey and aspirations.

His deep understanding of both technology and consciousness has been a profound source of insight and inspiration. Not only has his pioneering scientific work shaped the digital world we live in today, but his ideas gently invite us to explore the deeper connections between mind, matter, and reality, preparing us to imagine a future where an ever-increasing blurring of boundaries between technology and consciousness calls us to rethink:

• What it means to be human 🌿

• How to be a better leader of self and others 🏆

• How we impact our own reality 🌍

Save his post below to read (or watch the video) later—you might just discover new insights that spark your imagination! 💡 💥
