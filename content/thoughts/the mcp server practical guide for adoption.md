## A decision framework

This framework helps you figure out whether [[MCP server|MCP servers]] are right for your specific use case by systematically checking **eight critical constraint** categories. Each constraint gets scored, and the combined assessment guides your decision, a tru a compatibility test for you and MCP.

### The eight constraint categories

1. Performance & Latency Requirements
2. Security & Risk Tolerance
3. Token Economics & Cost Structure
4. Operational Complexity & Team Capacity
5. Data Locality & Compliance
6. Scalability & Resource Constraints
7. Integration Complexity & Technical Fit
8. Ecosystem Maturity & Vendor Risk

### What's included in this framework

- Detailed constraint assessments with specific questions and criteria for each category
- Quantitative scoring system that converts subjective assessments into actionable recommendations
- Three decision workflows for different organizational needs (quick assessment, detailed evaluation, phased approach)
- Real-world examples showing how the framework applies to common scenarios
- Constraint-specific mitigation strategies for addressing high-risk areas
- Practical guidance for moving from assessment to implementation

## Constraint assessment matrix

For each constraint, assess your requirements as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** impact.

> [!Note] Note on Scoring:
> Each assessment level corresponds to a point value used in the final decision matrix:
>
> - Low = 0 points (✅ Good fit)
> - Medium = 1 point (⚠️ Proceed with caution)
> - High = 2 points (❌ Poor fit).
>   Your total score across all eight constraints will determine the overall recommendation.

### 1. Performance & latency requirements

**Questions to ask:**

- What's your maximum acceptable response time?
- Are you building real-time or near-real-time applications?
- How sensitive are your users to delays?
- Do you have strict SLA requirements?

**Assessment:**

| Impact Level | Criteria                                                  | MCP Suitability             |

### 5. Data locality & compliance

**Questions to ask:**

- Where can your data be processed?
- What are your regulatory requirements?
- Do you need air-gapped or on-premises solutions?
- Are there data sovereignty concerns? (These can be surprisingly complex)

**Assessment:**

| Impact Level | Criteria                                                | MCP Suitability             |

### 6. Scalability & resource constraints

**Questions to ask:**

- What's your expected scale (users, requests, data)?
- Are you resource-constrained (memory, CPU, bandwidth)?
- Do you need to scale horizontally?
- Are you building for edge/mobile environments? (These have their own special challenges)

**Assessment:**

| Impact Level | Criteria                                               | MCP Suitability             |

## Decision matrix

### Scoring your assessment

Count your ratings across all eight constraints:

- **✅ Good fit**: 0 points
- **⚠️ Proceed with caution**: 1 point
- **❌ Poor fit**: 2 points

**Total score interpretation:**

| Score Range | Recommendation                | Action                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0-3**     | **Strong MCP Candidate**      | Proceed with confidence, focus on best practices                       |
| **4-7**     | **Conditional MCP Candidate** | Proceed carefully, address high-risk constraints first                 |
| **8-11**    | **Weak MCP Candidate**        | Consider alternatives, only proceed if benefits clearly outweigh risks |
| **12-16**   | **Poor MCP Candidate**        | Avoid MCP, use traditional integration approaches                      |

### Constraint-specific guidance

**If you scored high (❌) in:**

- **Performance**: Consider caching, async patterns, or non-MCP solutions
- **Security**: Wait for ecosystem maturity, use only trusted, audited servers, or tools that handle security for MCP servers.
- **Token Economics**: Reduce tool count, optimize descriptions, or find cost-effective alternatives
- **Operational Complexity**: Start with single server, invest in tooling, or outsource operations
- **Data Locality**: Use on-premises MCP servers or wait for compliant options
- **Scalability**: Architect for horizontal scaling or consider lighter-weight alternatives
- **Integration**: Start with greenfield components or invest in integration layer
- **Ecosystem**: Wait for maturity or build your own servers

## Practical decision workflows

### Workflow 1: The quick assessment

**For rapid go/no-go decisions:**

1. **Security Check**: Can you tolerate the current security risks?
2. **Performance Check**: Is >500ms latency acceptable?
3. **Complexity Check**: Can your team handle the operational overhead?

If any answer is "no," consider alternatives. (It's better to be honest upfront than sorry later!)

### Workflow 2: The detailed evaluation

**For thorough analysis:**

1. Complete the full constraint assessment
2. Calculate your total score
3. Identify your highest-risk constraints
4. Develop mitigation strategies for medium/high-risk areas
5. Create a pilot project to validate assumptions (this step is crucial—theory meets reality here)
6. Make go/no-go decision based on pilot results

### Workflow 3: The phased approach

**For risk-averse organizations:**

1. **Phase 1**: Internal tools only, single MCP server, non-critical data
2. **Phase 2**: Expand to more servers, still internal, moderate criticality
3. **Phase 3**: Customer-facing features, multiple servers, higher stakes
4. **Phase 4**: Mission-critical applications, full ecosystem adoption

Advance phases only after proving success and building expertise. (Patience here pays off big time!)

## Real-world examples

### Example 1: Customer service chatbot

**Constraints assessment:**

- Performance: Medium (1-2s acceptable) = ⚠️
- Security: Medium (customer data, but not financial) = ⚠️
- Token Economics: High (high volume, cost-sensitive) = ❌
- Operational: Medium (growing team) = ⚠️
- Data Locality: Low (cloud-based SaaS) = ✅
- Scalability: High lots --millions?-- of users) = ❌
- Integration: Low (new system) = ✅
- Ecosystem: Medium (some vendor risk) = ⚠️

**Score: 8 points = Weak MCP Candidate**
**Recommendation**: Consider alternatives or wait for ecosystem maturity. The economics just don't work out yet.

### Example 2: Internal developer tools

**Constraints assessment:**

- Performance: Low (background processing) = ✅
- Security: Low (internal, non-sensitive) = ✅
- Token Economics: Low (enterprise budget) = ✅
- Operational: Low (strong DevOps team) = ✅
- Data Locality: Low (internal cloud) = ✅
- Scalability: Low (a handful --or hundreds?-- of developers) = ✅
- Integration: Low (greenfield project) = ✅
- Ecosystem: Medium (can adapt to changes) = ⚠️

**Score: 1 point = Strong MCP Candidate**
**Recommendation**: Proceed with confidence. This is exactly the sweet spot MCP was designed for!

### Example 3: Financial trading system

**Constraints assessment:**

- Performance: High (<100ms required) = ❌
- Security: High (financial data, regulations) = ❌
- Token Economics: Medium (performance over cost) = ⚠️
- Operational: Low (expert team) = ✅
- Data Locality: High (strict compliance) = ❌
- Scalability: High (massive throughput) = ❌
- Integration: High (complex legacy systems) = ❌
- Ecosystem: High (need guaranteed stability) = ❌

**Score: 12 points = Poor MCP Candidate**
**Recommendation**: Avoid MCP entirely. Sometimes the old ways are still the best ways.

## Final thoughts

This framework gives you a systematic approach to [[MCP server]] adoption decisions. Remember:

1. **No single constraint should be ignored** - even one high-risk area can doom a project (learned this the hard way!)
2. **Context matters more than technology** - the same [[AI tool|tool]] can be perfect for one use case and terrible for another
3. **Start small and prove value** - even strong candidates benefit from pilot projects
4. **Reassess regularly** - as the ecosystem matures, your constraints may change

You don't have to avoid MCP servers entirely, but use them where they provide clear value while respecting real-world constraints. I hope you use this framework as your reality check: it'll might you from a lot of "seemed like a good idea at the time" moments!
